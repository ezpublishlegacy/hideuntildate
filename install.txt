1. Activate the extension and regenerate the eZ Publish autoloads file
2. Add Date & Time attributes to the classes for which you wish to have delayed publishing
3. Create an eZ Publish workflow of type "Hide Until Date". Map the relevant classes to their Date & Time attributes.
4. Assign the workflow to the "content/publish/after" trigger
5. Make sure you have the built-in eZ Publish workflow.php cronjob running

Note: This extension doesn't work on first publish if you have the in-edit Locations window enabled and an install newer than February 2014.
This is because of this commit: https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-legacy/commit/c3e8ff555964b165bf4b0872baa9014818086a59
It appears that the commit is trying to save the user's selection when saving a draft, but this does not work for the "Unchanged" selection, nor is "Unchanged" the default selection anymore.

Thus, until that is fixed, the workarounds are:
* Do not use the in-edit Locations window; or
* Tell users to manually select "Unchanged" on every first draft; or
* Override design/admin/templates/content/edit_locations.tpl and make "Unchanged" the default selection

If "Visible" is selected in the in-edit Locations window, this takes precedence over the workflow, because the "after publish" workflow is run before the Locations window selection is applied. (See kernel/content/edit.php.)
